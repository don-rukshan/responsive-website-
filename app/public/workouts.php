				<p class="text-justify">When the season hits, you're going to be lifting hot and heavy. Use those off months to take a neuromuscular holiday while still building a massive foundation for the contests to come.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">The problem with chasing your powerlifting PR all the time is that it can land you in a state of muscular fatigue, mental burnout, and overtraining—and lead to career-ending injuries.

					How, as a powerlifter, can you minimize the risk of burnout and severe injury while still prepping for the season to come? You do it by getting serious about regular off-season powerlifting training.</p><a class="btn btn-purple btn-lg" href="workout1.php">Click Here</a>

				<p class="text-justify">Getting strong is cool, but when you want to build muscle, you can be more creative than just loading more plates and lugging heavier dumbbells.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Lifters are getting smarter. They know that it's not just about how big their bench press is; going heavy isn't the only way to make muscles grow. Being able to add weight to the bar is the byproduct of the gains you make from previous workouts—and from implementing other training strategies, like eccentric loading and isometrics.</p>
